# How to contribute

Welcome! We are excited to have you here.

## Need help? 

See [the support document](SUPPORT.md) to find the appropriate place for your question. 

## Pitching ideas 

Do you have an idea for one of my projects that you want considered to be merged in? Exciting! I love ideas! 

Feel free to share ideas in the issues tracker (open the `/issues` webpage of the project). It's highly appreciated to share helpful details to increase chances of the idea being considered. 

## What is the roadmap? 

Want to know what is coming up next for the project? 

Some of my open source projects include a roadmap. If one exists, you will find it in the `/projects` webpage of the project. Browse through the items in the roadmap to see what is coming up for the project. Feel free to ask clarification questions or comments on the tasks in the roadmap. 

If you want to work on an item in the roadmap, leave a comment on the item. Depending on the status of the task, complexity of the task, and your history with the project, we will work you into the task in whatever way we think is best. 

## Testing

When you contribute to a project, it's greatly appreciated if you're able to test your code before opening a pull request. Each project is tested in different ways. Some are manually tested, some have a automated test suite, etc. I suggest reading developer documentation for the project you want to contribute to in order to find out what method of testing is used. 

We are all beginners at some point in our lives. If you're struggling to test a piece of code, feel free to ask for help. Someone in the community may have the availability to help you. 

## Coding conventions

I try my best to avoid discussing coding conventions or code styling in pull request reviews. To successfully do this, my projects prefer to leverage linting and formatting tools to enforce the project's coding conventions. 

To speedup getting your code reviewed, when you open a pull request, be sure to have your code formatted and passing all lint errors/warnings. Most projects have git hooks tooling to help you automate this ðŸ˜„. 

If you disagree with the coding conventions that the formatting and linting tools are enforcing, you can share suggestions to change them. I want to warn you, however, that if the suggestion is based on opinion (example: tabs vs spaces), the suggestion will probably not be accepted and we suggest keeping those to yourself. However, if a lint rule can improve the functionality of the code such as reducing the number of runtime bugs introduced into the codebase, these suggestions have a much higher chance of being considered. 

## Submitting changes

If you have code written that you want to be considered as part of the original project, time to open a pull request (assuming you've following the previous steps in this document). 

When you open a pull request, be sure to include helpful context in the description of the pull request. Include links to issues in the issues tracker where the idea was talked about. Mention how the code has been tested. If needed, explain why you chose the solution that you did for implementation. All of this is very helpful for the person reviewing the code and getting it merged faster.
