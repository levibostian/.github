# Support

Welcome! We are excited to have you here. If you have any questions, encounter any issues, or would like to contribute to the project, please refer to the following resources:

## Get Help

If you need help or have questions about using a project, please consider the following resources:

- Check the project's documentation. I try my best to write a section within the project's `README.md` pointing to all the documentation available in the project. 
  - Read code comments and automated tests. Besides documentation, tests and comments are a great resource to better understand the code. 
  - For particular lines of code you have questions about, view the git history of that code and what pull request merged that code. The pull request may contain helpful context explaining why and how something was done. 
- Search for existing issues in the issue tracker. Open the `/issues` webpage for the project to find it. 
- Ask a question in the project forums. Open the `/discussions` webpage for the project to find this. 

When in doubt, open an issue in the issue tracker. No matter what question or comment you have, that's a great starting point to direct you to the right place. No matter where you decide to share a question or comment, please try your best to include details. One or two sentences is usually not enough to get a conversation started. 

## Report Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving, please create a new issue in the issue tracker. Open the `/issues` webpage for the project to find it. When creating an issue, please include detailed information that can help us understand and address the problem effectively.
